    <h2>Turtles at Risk</h2>
    <p>Sea turtles are significantly impacted by climate change, which threatens their survival in several ways. Rising sea levels can erode nesting beaches, reducing the available habitat for females to lay their eggs. Additionally, increasing temperatures can skew the sex ratios of hatchlings, often resulting in more females than males. Warmer ocean temperatures also affect the availability of their prey, such as jellyfish, disrupting their feeding habits. Furthermore, habitat degradation from pollution and coral bleaching further endangers these ancient creatures. As climate change continues to escalate, the future of sea turtles hangs in the balance, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts.</p>
